# Locally-Weighted-Ensemble-Algorithm
The Locally Weighted Ensemble Algorithm was implemented on the 20 Newsgroup dataset and achieved an accuracy of over 75% for 3 out of 6 cases. The algorithm was originally developed by Jing Gao, Wei Fan, Jing Jiang and Jiawei Han as described in the research paper "Knowledge transfer via multiple model local structure mapping, 2008".
