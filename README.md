This project was done as part of the IE506-Machine-Learning-Principles-and-Techniques course (an Institute Elective Course), under the guidance of Prof. P. Balamurugan, IEOR Dept., IIT Bombay.

**Description:**
In this project I have implemented Locally Weighted Ensemble Algorithm for Binary Classification Task on text data. The Locally Weighted Ensemble Algorithm was implemented on the 20 Newsgroup dataset and achieved an accuracy of over 75% for 3 out of 6 cases. The algorithm was originally developed by Jing Gao, Wei Fan, Jing Jiang and Jiawei Han as described in the research paper "Knowledge transfer via multiple model local structure mapping, 2008". Please read the project report for detailed description and refer the ipynb file for the python code. The 6 different ipynb files represent 6 different experiments with the 20 newsgroup dataset.

The Locally Weighted Ensemble (LWE) is a novel algorithm that combines multiple models to make predictions. It is useful in
transfer learning problems where training and test domains are different. The LWE assigns weights to individual models based
on their local behaviors at each test example, which allows it to adapt to different test examples.
The motivation behind this project is to improve the prediction accuracy in situations where the training and test domains
differ, a common scenario in many real-world applications. This report provides an overview of the project, detailing the
different steps in the algorithm, the experiments conducted and results.
The report is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys the relevant literature focussing on Sample Selection Bias and Covariate
Shift , Section 3 describes the proposed project, Section 4 provides details on the dataset used, Section 5 outlines the
experiment performed, Section 6 presents the results, Section 7 discusses future work, and Section 8 concludes the report.
