Then we calculate the average similarity for each test sample that is s_avg. So if average similarity for a test sample is greater than 0.5 then the final prediction gotten from pLWE will be used for that test sample if not then we discard the prediction made by the pLWE model and consider a new unsupervised clustering model, (which in our case is K means Clustering) to make the predictions, the details of how the predictions are made given below in the implementation of Local structure based adjustment step."
